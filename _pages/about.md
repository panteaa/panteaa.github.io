I hold a PhD in Computer Science from the [University of Illinois Chicago (UIC)](https://www.uic.edu/), where I was a member of the Human-Computer Interaction Laboratory and the [Electronic Visualization Laboratory](https://www.evl.uic.edu/). I worked under the guidance of Professor [Debaleena Chattopadhyay](http://debaleena.com/). Prior to my PhD, I earned my MS in Computer Science from UIC and my BS in Computer Engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology.

My research interests lie primarily in the area of Human-Computer Interaction. I am experienced in and passionate about:

* Immersive Technologies (VR/AR/MR)
* Mid-air and spatial Interaction
* Human-AI Interaction and Collaboration
* Human-Centered Data Science


Please explore my work and feel free to reach out for inquiries or collaborations. I am also on the job market, actively seeking HCI-related research positions. If you have any opportunities or leads, please don’t hesitate to contact me.
